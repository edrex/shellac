Shellac (after the [ancient bio polymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac)) is a library for creating self-contained user shell environments using [Nix Flakes](https://zimbatm.com/notes/nixflakes).

It's a grab bag of functionality I needed in creating [aquiferma/noter](https://github.com/aquiferma/noter), that I wanted to be able to reuse in other shells:

- Interactive menu generation
- Very basic env-scoped service management

As it matures, I hope it will be useful to others who want to create domain shell environments using flakes, and help foster the emergence of an ecosystem of "grab and go" standalone shells.
